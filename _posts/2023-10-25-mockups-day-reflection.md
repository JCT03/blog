My primary responsibilities for the group are team organization and SQL Schema design. So, much of what I have done so far has revolved around these two things, but I am also starting to look into options for the museum gallery display, which is a very important part of our website. 

In our team meetings leading up to the client meeting, I helped to get us all organized and sort of carve out the responsibilities that each of us would have to the project. Then, in preparation for the client meeting, I made a list of questions to make sure that we got answered. In the meeting itself, I used these questions to sort of guide us along and to make sure that we got enough from Lynita to get started on the project. 

With the meeting complete, I began to work on compiling everything from the meeting into the slideshow that we would show to the class. This includes creating an entity-relationship diagram that I later based the SQL Schema on. To prepare for the presentation, I pulled the different resources that we had created and put them into slides that would be suitable to present to the class. I also went through the Google Form to make sure that we would have everything that we needed in our presentation. 

With the presentation complete, I shifted my attention to the SQL Schema, which I created based on the entity relationship diagram. Our schema is fairly straightforward and should not be an issue to implement. After the schema was completed, I began to look around for templates that we can use for the gallery. I ended up finding one that I think will work pretty well and I share it with the group. I then created the mockup of the gallery based on this template. I helped a little bit on the other pages and, of course, we had some group discussion about the layout, but I primarily worked on that gallery page and the info page for the gallery. 

As we go forward with the project, I am planning to take ownership over the gallery page. I will also be continuing to help keep everyone organized and make sure we are meeting the deadlines for our project.
