The Razor Pages tutorial was not too difficult, but it was a little tedious just to make sure I was doing everything exactly right. 

The process of creating everything itself was very simple. All I had to do was run a few commands and everything I needed would just appear, which was very interesting to see. I could tell that trying to create everything from scratch would have been an incredibly complicated task, so I am very grateful to just have to run a few commands from the terminal. It was also very simple to create the database itself with the required columns of proper types. 

One place where I got stuck was trying to run the application. When I tried to run the program, nothing would really happen. So, after a while of doing that, I looked for solutions online and saw a recommendation to close the Visual Studio Code application and restart it. Once I did this, the IDE asked if I wanted to add the required build components and then it ran perfectly. The same thing happened when I tried to do it on my own, but restarting the application is an easy enough fix. 

The tutorial translated quite well to creating my own application, which can be found [here][lab-link] I actually ended up just going through the tutorial again as I had not memorized all of the steps. I would simply switch out the names and types in the tutorial with those of my own application. This process worked really well and made it very easy to customize the page. The only hiccup was trying to use the player number as the unique identifier. I could not figure out how to make it work to where you could edit the identifier, so I ended up leaving the id in place and adding a column for the player number. 

I see Razor Pages as similar to the Jekyll framework in the way that it takes something very complicated and creates a template that makes it very simple. However, it differs in the actual way you interact with the framework. In Jekyll, you simply create pages in markdown files that automatically become html pages. However, in Razor Pages, you use the terminal to run commands that do the bulk of the work and you actually end up creating very few files manually. 

I would feel very confident creating another Razor application, so long as I had access to the tutorial. I will not pretend that I have memorized every command, but I have a base-level understanding of the process that would allow me to go through it easily again.
