The deployment tutorial was very straightforward and easy to complete. The only downside was that we could not find a way to host the website using the free plan. 

Since the tutorial was pretty short, we just decided to work together on it. I took the lead and ran the project from my computer. It just made more sense for us to do it all from one place considering that a lot of the work took place on the Azure online platform. It was good practice communicating what I was doing to the rest of the group and having them look over it with me. 

Before creating the program, I registered for the student account so that I could get $100 in free credits. Then, we created the program. However, we did have one problem when we initially created the program: none of the resources were created. We started to look at adding the resources separately, but we decided that, since we were so early in the tutorial, it would just be easier to restart. So, we deleted our progress and started again. 

Once we did this, the process was very straightforward. We followed all of the steps in the tutorial and were able to get it launched without any problems. The process of running commands was easy and we were able to do everything from the browser, just like the tutorial said. Oddly, at one point the website would not work when we tried to show it to Dr. Goadrich. However, it started working again soon and the log showed a problem had been fixed by the Azure system, so we did not have to do anything extra there. 

The only real drawback of the process is that it would not run for free. Once the tutorial was complete, we tried to downgrade the plan to the free version. The problem is that, in order to downgrade, you have to disable the vNet and the website does not run without it. So, unless there is some way to configure things that we do not know about, it seems like the only option is to use the credits. This presents a problem when we are publishing the museum project because we will not have enough credits to host it for too long. Hopefully, we can work with Dr. Goodrich and the museum to publish it for them somewhere where they can take on that fee.
