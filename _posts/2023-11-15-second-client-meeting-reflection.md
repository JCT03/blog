Most of my recent work has been on the gallery page and team organization. 

For the gallery page, I copied the index page and the details page from the artworks and modified it to show the information in a gallery and then created the details pages to show the image larger.. I also figured out a process to display images on the website. For the gallery specifically, I actually ended up combining two gallery templates. The first one I liked the display of, but it was not created for images of varying sizes. So, I used another template to add the columns that would allow dynamic positioning of the gallery cards. The artwork info pages themselves are quite simple and actually look a lot like the details pages. Lynita has stated that she wants it to be very simple, so we are trying to respect that. However, the styles that Scott and Henry apply to the whole website, such as the fonts, will make them look nice. 

To display the images on the website, I am able to host them using Google Photos. There is actually a website that takes a link from google photos and produces a link that you can use to embed the image into a website. I think that this will work well for our purpose because Lynita will be able to easily access Google Photos to add new artwork and then use these links in the website. 

For the second client meeting, I made another list of the clarifications that we needed and got the demo ready to present to Lynita. The meeting itself went very well. We were able to clarify everything we needed, create a plan to allow Lynita to add new collections in the future, and get her feedback on the website. Overall, she was very happy with it and said that the gallery was exactly what she had been imagining. 

Going forward with the project, I am going to continue to work on the gallery. Ted is taking the lead on updating the database based on discussions that we had after the meeting. I have also offered my help to him if he would like it. Once that is done, I will go back into the gallery pages to update those to represent the updated database. I am also trying to distribute tasks so that everyone has something to work on and we can actually have a ready to go product by the end of the semester.
